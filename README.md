This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## To Run
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## To deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Alt Deploy
Digital ocean via `next build`
then upload the static site in the /out/ folder generated by `next build`
to github then point DO's static site hosting to that github repo
you can keep the repo private but it doesnt matter if you dont


## /public/
Contains the images/assets

## /pages/
Contains the world 3D page
and index.js the main site

## /styles/Home.module.css
all css in here other than the global.css which isn't where things were done

## /contracts/ 
Has the dummy NFT contract I deployed to test the mint and contract data fetching functions

## Details
there is a contract address and contract abi variable at the top of index.js
that is where the final contract goes

## Note
The alchemy API key is not in an .env file because you have to manually input environment vars into vercel and thats annoying until full deploy
